config AUFS_FS
	bool "Aufs (Advanced multi layered unification filesystem) support"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	Aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as Unionfs,
	which unifies several directories and provides a merged single
	directory.
	In the early days, aufs was entirely re-designed and
	re-implemented Unionfs Version 1.x series. Introducing many
	original ideas, approaches and improvements, it becomes totally
	different from Unionfs while keeping the basic features.

	Specifies the maximum number of branches (or member directories)
	in a single aufs. The larger value consumes more system
	resources and has a minor impact to performance.

	help
	If you want to modify files on branches directly, eg. bypassing aufs,
	and want aufs to detect the changes of them fully, then enable this
	option and use 'udba=inotify' mount option.
	It will have a negative impact to the performance.
	See detail in aufs.5.
